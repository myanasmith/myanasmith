# Hi, I'm Myana Smith 👋

Welcome to my portfolio! I’m a passionate front-end developer currently on a journey to combine my love for **technology**, **psychology**, and **creative problem-solving**. I’m building my skills through SheCodes and am excited to share my progress as I grow in the world of web development.

## About Me

I have a unique background in **communications**, and a deep fascination inspires my coding journey with **psychology** and **how the human mind works**. I’m particularly interested in how people think, process information, and make decisions and how this intersects with **technology**. My passion lies in exploring how tech impacts **mental health**, cognition, and behavior and how we can create ethical, inclusive tech solutions that positively influence people's lives.

As a first-generation college graduate, I'm driven by the challenge of breaking into the tech industry with a fresh perspective and an eagerness to learn. I believe that understanding the intersection of **tech** and the **human mind** is crucial for creating ethical, effective, and impactful technology.

Outside of coding, I'm deeply passionate about:
- **Psychology** and the science of how people think 🧠
- **Photography** 📸
- **Mental health** and **self-care** 🧘🏾‍♀️
- **Traveling** and exploring new cultures 🌍
- **Reading** (especially while traveling!) 📖
- My love for **EDM music** 🎶 and all things that help me feel nurtured and grounded.

## What I’m Working On

- 📚 **Learning**: I’m currently enrolled in the **SheCodes Bootcamp**, where I’m learning **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and More** to create responsive and accessible websites.
- 💻 **Projects**: Check out the projects I’ve completed so far in my portfolio below!
- 🌱 **Future Goals**: I’m excited to integrate my coding skills with my passion for **psychology** and **AI ethics**, exploring how technology affects the brain, behavior, and human interactions.
- 🎓 **Long-term**: Preparing for a future in **cognitive science** or **AI ethics**, and considering graduate programs that align with my interdisciplinary interests.
